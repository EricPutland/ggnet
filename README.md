# ggnet: simple network plots with ggplot2

A while ago, Moritz Marbach coded the [`plotg()`][mm] function to visualize networks with `ggplot2` in R. 

Here's a slightly modified version that takes the following arguments:

    ggnet(net,                      # an object of class network
          size = 12,                # node size
          alpha = .75,              # transparency
          weight.method = "sum",    # weight nodes by "degree", "indegree", "outdegree" or "none" (unweighted)
          weight.quartiles = FALSE, # break weights to quartiles
          node.group = NULL,        # what to color the nodes with
          node.colors = NULL,       # what colors to use for the node classes
          names = c("", ""),        # what to call the node color and node weight legends
          label.nodes = FALSE,      # add vertex names in small print
          segment.size = .25,       
          arrow.size = .25,         
          legend.position = "right")

The function is not (yet) robust to omitting some of the options above, but as long as you have an object of class `network` with something to color the nodes, you should be fine. If you have networks objects in different classes than `network`, have a look at the [`intergraph`][ig] package to handle conversion.
