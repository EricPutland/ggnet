# ggnet: simple network plots with ggplot2

A while ago, Moritz Marbach coded the [`plotg()`][mm] function to visualize networks with `ggplot2` in R.

Here's a slightly modified version that takes the following arguments:

    ggnet(net,                       # an object of class network
				  mode = "fruchtermanreingold", # placement algorithm
				  size = 12,                # node size
				  alpha = .75,              # transparency
				  weight.method = "none",   # what to weight the nodes with: "degree", "indegree", "outdegree"
				  names = c("", ""),        # what to call the node color and node weight legends
				  node.group = NULL,        # what to color the nodes with
				  node.color = NULL,        # what colors to use for the node classes
				  node.alpha = NULL,        # transparency for nodes (inherits from alpha)
				  segment.alpha = NULL,     # transparency for links (inherits from alpha)
				  segment.color = "grey",   # default links are rgb(190, 190, 190)
				  segment.size  = .25,      # set to 0 to remove from plot
				  arrow.size = 0,           # set to 0 to remove from plot
				  label.nodes = FALSE,      # add vertex names in small print; can be a list of vertex names
				  quantize.weights = FALSE, # break weights to quartiles
				  legend.position = "right")# set to "none" to remove from plot

The function needs an object of class `network` and automatically handles the conversion of objects of class `igraph` by calling the [`intergraph`][ig] package.

# Examples

![French MPs on Twitter](example1.png)

A plot of Twitter connexions between 339 French MPs currently in office, colored by parliamentary groups and quartile-weighted by degree. See [`functions.R`][fn] for network exploration routines.

Data assembled by scraping a few web sources in May 2013 with the help of [Jonathan Chibois][jc] and Benjamin Ooghe-Tabanou from [Regards Citoyens][rc]. My [blog post at Polit'bistro][pb] has more details.

The `ggnet()` function returns a `ggplot` object in which nodes are represented by points that can be colored and/or weighted. The network above can therefore be set to look like this when the nodes are weighted by indegree:

![](example2.png)

		ggnet(net, size = 6, segment.size = 0, weight = "indegree", legend = "none") + 
		  geom_density2d()

The node colors are set through a group variable colored by a discrete palette. Node groups can be any vector containing as many items as there are nodes in the network. Hence, to verify that the dual structure shown above corresponds to the left-right party divide:

![](example3.png)

		rightwing = ifelse(mp.groups == "NI", NA, mp.groups %in% c("UDI", "UMP"))
		ggnet(net, node.group = rightwing, alpha = .25, name = "Rightwing group")

The function can label all or a selection of nodes, identified by vertex names. See, for example, how party polarization is much less obvious when you look at a single individual's network:

![](example4.png)

		nkm = list("nk_m", ids$Twitter %in% who.follows(df, "nk_m"))
		ggnet(net, size = 6, label = nkm[[1]], node.group = nkm[[2]], alpha = .25, name = "Follows NKM")
